  <div class="headline">ICC Commits Massive Blunder On Virat Kohli's No. 1 ODI Ranking, Forced By Fans To Fix</div>
  <div class="sub-headline">Virat Kohli's rise to the No. 1 spot in the ICC ODI batting rankings came with an interesting set of events unfolding on social media.</div>
  <div class="author">E.V.Rishith</div>
  <p class="text"> Kohli's sensational recent form has seen him rise to the No. 1 spot in the ICC ODI rankings for the first time in nearly five years. The 37-year-old has slammed five scores of 50 or more in his last six matches, including two centuries. However, soon after, the ICC incorrectly posted a social media graphic of how many days Kohli had spent as the No. 1 ODI batter across his career. ICC's mistake was pointed out by several netizens, and eventually it was amended</p>
  <p class="text">In the initial graphic, the ICC had stated that Kohli had spent 825 days as the No. 1-ranked men's ODI batter across his career, ranking him 10th in the list of most days spent by a cricketer as the top-ranked ODI batter.</p>
  <p class="text">However, this was seemingly a glaring error as several previous documents of the ICC mention that Kohli has spent 1,547 days in the top spot.

      Eventually, the social media post was deleted by the ICC, and they also reiterated that Kohli had indeed spent 1,547 days as the No. 1 ODI batter.
